    <h1>MY FAVORITE CITY</h1>
    <p>My favorite city is Lagos, Nigeria. Lagos is the largest city in Nigeria and one of the fastest-growing cities in
        the world. It is known for its vibrant culture, bustling markets, and beautiful beaches.</p>
    <p>One of the things I love most about Lagos is its diversity. The city is a melting pot of different cultures,
        languages, and traditions. You can find people from all over Nigeria and even other parts of Africa living and
        working together in harmony.</p>
    <p>Lagos is also famous for its nightlife. The city comes alive at night with numerous clubs, bars, and restaurants
        offering a variety of entertainment options. Whether you want to dance to Afrobeat music or enjoy a quiet dinner
        by the beach, Lagos has something for everyone.</p>
    <p>Another reason I love Lagos is its food. The city is known for its delicious street food, including jollof rice,
        suya, and puff-puff. There are also many restaurants that serve traditional Nigerian dishes as well as
        international cuisine.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, Lagos is a city full of life, culture, and excitement. It is a place where you can experience the
        true essence of Nigeria and its people. I am proud to call Lagos my favorite city.</p>
